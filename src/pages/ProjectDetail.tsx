      problem: "Gen Z consumers ‚Äî especially women aged 18‚Äì30 ‚Äî consistently reported anxiety after weekends of overspending. In 100+ peer interviews, 80%+ of respondents said they knew their spending patterns but struggled to execute on budgets. Traditional budgeting apps visualize past spending but fail to influence real-time decision-making. From an analytics perspective, we defined the core product problem as: 'How can we measure and reduce the frequency and intensity of self-sabotaging transactions in discretionary spending categories?'",
